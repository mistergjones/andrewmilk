## General info

This basic website was quickly designed for a friend who owns and run a small milk delivery business. The business owner essentially relies on "word of mouth" for new sales.

He wanted something basic that he may wish to use later on.

## Task Time Boxer Link

-   The link to his website is:
    [http://andrewmilk.surge.sh]

## MVP

The following were the key requirements in meeting the MVP/POC.

-   a basic website with a contact button for emails that he could respond to.
-   a simple layout that captures the key products that he offers.
-   no need to list prices given the senstivity and competition from other small businesses.

## Future Functionality

Future functionality can incorporate the following:

-   A backend where customers can login and select what they would like to order.
-   This order upon submission to be submitted automatically to his email.
